# Known Issues and Limitations

## Performance Issues

### LP Solver
- **GLPK comparison**: Ralph is 2-13x slower than GLPK per iteration on larger problems (500+ variables)
- **Dual simplex stability**: Dual simplex can accumulate reduced cost errors, sometimes falling back to primal simplex (see `dual_simplex.c`)

### MIP Solver
- **Set partitioning problems**: Very slow on equality-constrained MIP problems (e.g., 37s vs 0.0002s for GLPK on 30-variable problems)
- **Large facility location**: Times out on medium-sized problems (210 variables, 10 integer)
- **Limited presolve for MIP**: Lightweight presolve (mask 0x110F) is enabled by default for MIP but aggressive techniques (singleton cols, probing, proportional rows) cause slowdowns

## Cut Generation Bugs

### c-MIR Cuts From Purely Continuous Rows (cuts.c:cmir_build_cut) — FIXED

- **Severity**: High — generated invalid cuts that removed the true integer optimum
- **Status**: Fixed. `cmir_row_has_integer_support()` now gates cut construction.
- **Trigger**: Any model where a c-MIR candidate row has no integer variable in
  its support, including after aggregation.
- **Root cause**: The MIR derivation strengthens `sum a_j x_j <= b` into
  `... <= floor(b)`. That rounding is justified only by the integrality of at
  least one variable in the row. `cmir_build_cut()` applied it unconditionally,
  so on a purely continuous row it tightened the right-hand side by
  `f_0 ∈ (0,1)` with nothing to justify it — an inequality that removes
  feasible points rather than fractional ones.
- **Evidence**: On `fw_bench_config_milp_100()` seed 125 with
  `RALPH_ENABLE_MIR_ROOT_CUTS=1`, all 10 generated cuts came from rows with
  zero integer variables, and 8 of the 10 excluded the true optimum. Ralph
  reported 1595.124441 as OPTIMAL against a true optimum of 1585.247322 —
  feasible, validating, and wrong, so nothing downstream flagged it.
- **Fix**: Rows with no integer support are skipped before the `(C, delta)`
  separation search, counted in `root_mir_rows_no_integer`, and rejected again
  inside `cmir_build_cut()` (the function that performs the rounding).
- **Side effect**: The invalid cuts were also driving a branch-and-bound
  explosion. The seed=125 MIR-on solve went from roughly five minutes to
  0.1 seconds.
- **Regression test**: `test_raw_milp100_seed125_shifted_presolve_mir_optin()`
  in `fuelwise/bench/test_validator.c`, gating in CI via `test-c`.
- **Earlier work on this entry**: two back-substitution sign errors (the
  complementation and upper-bound constants were added rather than subtracted)
  were corrected previously, along with a safety check rejecting cuts whose
  minimum possible LHS exceeds their RHS. Both are still in place. The check is
  a cheap sanity net, not the fix — it never caught this family, because a
  cut over continuous variables with finite bounds looks perfectly satisfiable.
- **Still open**: `generate_mir_cuts()` also carries a narrower heuristic that
  drops all-positive cuts with exactly one integer term when a shifted pivot
  was used. It is unrelated to the bug above and no test currently requires it;
  it should be re-examined on its own terms.
- **Note**: c-MIR remains opt-in behind `RALPH_ENABLE_MIR_ROOT_CUTS`.

### No Recovery When LP Becomes Infeasible After Cuts (mip.c:1146-1154)
- **Severity**: Medium — compounded the c-MIR bug above; still worth fixing on its own
- **Root cause**: When the LP becomes infeasible after adding cuts, `mip.c` blindly sets `solver->status = solver->lp_solver->status` (INFEASIBLE) and returns immediately, without checking `solver->has_incumbent`. If the diving heuristic already found a valid integer solution, the solver should report OPTIMAL.
- **Fix**: Check for existing incumbent before propagating LP infeasibility. Optionally attempt recovery by removing the last batch of cuts.

### GMI Slack Variable Projection
- GMI cuts with significant positive slack coefficients (>0.1) are rejected to prevent cutting off integer feasible points
- This makes GMI cuts mostly ineffective for >= constraints
- See `cuts.c:generate_gmi_cut()` for the rejection logic

## Numerical Issues

### Artificial Variable Residuals
- After Big-M phase 1, artificial variables may have tiny non-zero values (1e-5 to 1e-6)
- These are numerical noise but were previously causing incorrect objective reporting
- Fixed in commit `eb50d7e` by computing objective from original variables only

### LU Factorization
- LU update accumulates numerical errors over many pivots
- Refactorization every 50 iterations helps but may not be sufficient for ill-conditioned problems
- Sparse triangular solves use reach-based algorithms which can accumulate rounding errors

## API Issues

### Return Value Confusion
- `ralph_optimize()` returns 0 for success, -1 for error (not the solve status)
- Use `ralph_get_status()` to get the actual solve status
- This was a source of bugs in benchmark code (fixed in commit `eb50d7e`)

## Missing Features

### LP Features
- Barrier/interior point method
- Network simplex for pure network problems
- Basis crash procedures

### MIP Features
- Primal heuristics (RINS, feasibility pump)
- Conflict analysis and learning
- Dual steepest edge pricing
- Parallel branch and bound

## Test Coverage Gaps

### Untested Scenarios
- Very sparse problems (density < 5%)
- Highly degenerate problems
- Problems with many equality constraints
- Problems requiring many branching iterations
- Numerical edge cases (very large/small coefficients)

## Platform-Specific Issues

### macOS
- No known platform-specific issues

### Linux
- Not actively tested but should work

### Windows
- Not tested, may need build system adjustments

## Workarounds

### For slow MIP problems
1. Try adding cuts manually if you know the problem structure
2. Use `max_nodes` parameter to limit exploration
3. Use `time_limit` parameter to cap solve time
4. Consider reformulating with fewer equality constraints

### For numerical issues
1. Scale your problem data to avoid very large/small coefficients
2. Reduce iteration count between refactorizations if needed
3. Use `verbose=2` to see iteration details
